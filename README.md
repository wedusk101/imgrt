# C++

A simple ray tracer written in C++ for educational purposes only. I plan on implementing Peter Shirley's Ray tracing in a Weekend later on. This piece of
software is strictly work in progress and is a side project for getting the very basic understanding clear about ray tracing and rendering.

For details on the included image viewer please refer to the project page at

I used Photoshop's automation features for converting the .ppm image sequences to TIFF for rendering the video of the animation. I will be using some other library for rendering
to different image formats as Photoshop CC 2019 doesn't seem to recognize image sequences in PPM. The library "stb_image.h" seems to be a good choice.
